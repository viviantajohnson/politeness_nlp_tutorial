##### Install Python + spaCy using Miniconda (Windows setup) #####

# These instructions will have you:
#    1. Install a tool called Miniconda (it manages Python environments)
#    2. Create a separate Python environment just for spaCy (so nothing conflicts)
#    3. Install spaCy and the English language model
#    4. Tell R’s spacyr package to use that Python


### Step 0: Close RStudio (recommended)
#    If RStudio is open, close it. This prevents R from “locking onto” an old Python during setup.


### Step 1: Install Miniconda
#    1. Open your web browser and search: “Miniconda download Windows”
#    2. Download Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit (x86_64).
#    3. Run the installer.
#    4. During install:
#        -Choose Just Me (easiest)
#        -Keep the default install location
#        -If you see an option like “Add Miniconda to PATH”: it’s okay either way. (Not required if you always use Anaconda Prompt, which you will).
#    5. When finished, you should have an app called “Anaconda Prompt” in your Start menu.


### Step 2: Open Anaconda Prompt
#    1. Click the Windows Start button
#    2. Type: Anaconda Prompt
#    3. Open it. You’ll see a black terminal window with text.

## Step 3: Create a Python environment for spaCy

### Step 3: In **Anaconda Prompt**, copy/paste this and press Enter:
conda create -n spacyr-env python=3.11 -y
# This creates a new environment named spacyr-env with Python 3.11.
