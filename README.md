# politeness_nlp_tutorial

This tutorial uses a dataset from the subreddit r/ChangeMyView (or CMV). CMV is a Reddit community where someone posts a belief or opinion they hold and invites others to challenge it with the goal of genuinely reconsidering their view. If a reply meaningfully changes the original poster’s (OP's) mind (even partially), the OP awards a “delta” (Δ) to recognize that the comment was persuasive. The subreddit is heavily moderated and emphasizes good-faith debate, clear reasoning, and civility. You can visit CMV [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/).
