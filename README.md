# politeness_nlp_tutorial

This tutorial shows how to analyze open-ended text stored in a dataset using the ```politeness``` R package. It walks through loading sample data (_cmv_sample_data.xlsx_) and extracting politeness-related linguistic features from text (e.g., gratitude, hedges, apologies, requests). Click [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/politeness/vignettes/politeness.html) for more information about the ```politeness``` R package, including descriptions of each linguistic feature.  

The _cmv_sample_sata.xlsx dataset_ from the subreddit r/ChangeMyView (or CMV). CMV is a Reddit community where someone posts a belief or opinion they hold and invites others to challenge it with the goal of genuinely reconsidering their view. If a reply meaningfully changes the original poster’s (OP's) mind (even partially), the OP awards a “delta” (Δ) to recognize that the comment was persuasive. The subreddit is heavily moderated and emphasizes good-faith debate, clear reasoning, and civility. You can visit CMV [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/).
