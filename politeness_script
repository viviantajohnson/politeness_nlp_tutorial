# Many politeness features depend on dependency parsing (grammar parsing), meaning you need to run SpaCy through spacyr.
# If you can run SpaCy locally, run the following:
install.packages("spacyr")
spacyr::spacy_install()          # installs spaCy + a default English model (in most setups)
spacyr::spacy_initialize()       # start spaCy for this R session

# If SpaCy is painful on your machine, you can still run an incomplete but usable version by setting 'parser = "none"' in 'politeness()'.
# You’ll lose/approximate some features.
